    "about":"In the fall of 2017, the band was formed by Ryu Shinomiya (Dr.) and Battan (Gt.), who met during a shared live performance.\nIn 2021, Itasan, the owner of a live music venue called 'Ibaraki Anarchy,' which is one of their regular performance spaces, joined as the bassist. The group is now a three-member hardcore idol band that sings and dances, primarily active in Osaka.\n\nIn 2019, Stacked State embarked on their first-ever tour, which was also their debut overseas tour titled 'Stacked State Workaholic Journey in Southeast Asia.' Despite a major mishap of missing their flight on the first day, the tour ended in great success and high acclaim.\n\nCurrently, they perform songs from Ryu Shinomiya's other project, 'ni. (N.I.),'along with his own extensive repertoire. However, with over 20 years' worth of songs, they have yet to create original tracks as Stacked State, spending their days performing from Shinomiya's collection, which now numbers over 100 songs.",
